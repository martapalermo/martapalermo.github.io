                                <div> For this project we were tasked with building a graphic 
                                    implementation of the famous card game, Memory, 
                                    while using Python and its graphics Turtle library. 
                                    The game allows the user to input their name, and select 
                                    the number of cards they want to play with (8, 10 or 12 total). 
                                    The user is then instructed to click on the cards and find the corresponding matches. 
                                    Their live status gets recorded in the Player Status 
                                    bar on the bottom of the screen. Here the player gets to see 
                                    their cumulative guesses and their total successful matches. 
                                    Once the game is over, the leader board records the final score of the player,
                                    and depending on how well they performed, they're name gets displayed 
                                    in the top 8 slots in the next new game played. </div>

                                  <div> For this project we were tasked with finding a partner and building an easy animator -
                                      a program that can display simple shape animations in its window by reading svg 
                                      or text file descriptions of the animations. My partner and I worked together in Java, 
                                      virtually through GitHub, and using Model View Controller architecture created this 
                                      animator program. The program runs in IntelliJ, where we load a file (either svg or txt) 
                                      that holds descriptions of the shapes, their colors, their sizes and their transformations 
                                      throughout the animation. The example shown in the screenshot is from our Towers of Hanoi 
                                      animation description. In our implementation of the animator, we provide buttons 
                                      that allow to manipulate the animation by either starting it, pausing it, resuming it, 
                                      restarting it, speeding it up or down and choosing to create an endless loop out of it or 
                                      have it run its course once. </div>

                                 <div> For this semester project we worked in groups of 5, 
                                     and were tasked with coming up with a user engaging app idea 
                                     to then build and run on Android devices. 
                                     My group and I came up with an app named TopDog. 
                                     Our app is geared towards dog owners, specifically new ones, 
                                     and is supposed to be used as a way to keep track of their 
                                     walking and socializing responsibilities. 
                                     This app starts off with our registration page, where the user 
                                     inputs basic contact information. Once the user registers, 
                                     it takes them back to the login page where they're then brought 
                                     to their home screen. There, the users can navigate to the area leader board, 
                                     which shows the 'top dogs' in their geographic area (the dogs with the most walks),  
                                     allows them to send them pats (our equivalent of a like). Users have access 
                                     to a gps walk tracker, which tells them where and how long they walked, 
                                     their profile page, where they can upload a profile picture, and a summary 
                                     page of all their walks, with dates, duration and distances. </div>
