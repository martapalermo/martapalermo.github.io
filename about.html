                    <h1>Hi, I'm Marta!</h1>
                    <p> I just recently moved to Seattle from Boston, but I hail all the way from Milan Italy, where I was born and raised - close to where the picture on the home page was taken actually!
                        In Boston I attended Northeastern University, for my undergrad, where I got my Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience. For the longest time I thought I wanted to go to 
                        medical school, so a lot of my past course work and professional work experience certainly reflects that!
                    </p>
                    <p>I spent several years working at Massachusetts General Hospital as an MRI Research Technician/ Clinical Research Coordinator. 
                        My main role was lead phlebotomist, and helping research participants through their scanning and psychophysiology sessions at the MGH Martinos Imaging Center in Charlestown MA. 
                        On top of running sessions my colleagues and I did most of the data scoring and analysis - which involved some basic coding - my first exposure!
                        Our lab often hosted numerous guest speakers that ranged from clinical affective scientists, to criminal psychologist as well as many computer scientists. 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        The combination of speakers and being exposed to Comp Sci concepts and basic programming helped me realize that it was time for me to make a career change! 
                        It was after our numerous guest speakers talking about the overlap between the two fields of Neuroscience and Computer Science, my interest peaked and I decided to make the switch and get my Masters in CS.
                        Thanks to the ALIGN MSCS program at Northeastern, I was able to gradually switch over from my clinical background and start my coding adventure.
                        I am now starting my second year of my Masters of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern and am more excited than ever to continue pursuing this exciting and ever evolving field!
                    </p>  
                    <p> More to come...</p>
