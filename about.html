                    <h1>Hi, I'm Marta!</h1>
                    <p> I just recently moved to Seattle from Boston, but I hail all the way from Milan Italy, where I was born and raised - close to where the picture on the home page was taken actually!
                        In Boston I attended Northeastern University, for my undergrad, where I got my Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience. For the longest time I thought I wanted to go to 
                        medical school, so a lot of my past course work and professional work experience certainly reflects that. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I spent several years working at Massachusetts General Hospital as an MRI Research Technician/ Clinical Research Coordinator. 
                        My main role was lead phlebotomist, as well as helping research participants through their scanning and psychophysiology sessions at the MGH Martinos Imaging Center in Charlestown MA. 
                        On top of running the scanner sessions, my colleagues and I did most of the data scoring and analysis - which involved some basic coding - my first exposure. 
                        Our lab often hosted numerous guest speakers that ranged from clinical affective scientists, to criminal psychologist as well as many computer scientists. 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        It was after our numerous guest speakers talking about the overlap between the two fields of Neuroscience and Computer Science, my interest peaked and I decided to make the switch and get my Masters in CS.
                        Thanks to the ALIGN MSCS program at Northeastern, I was able to transition from my clinical background and start my coding adventure as someone with little to no prior technical experience in the field. 
                        Surviving the first year, two bridge semesters was definitely rough, but absolutely worth it. At this point in the game, I'm starting to navigate the different disciplines and specializations available in the field, and I'm beginning to hone in on what I think I'd like to focus on; front end development.
                        I am now finishing up the first half of my second year in my MSCS program at Northeastern University and can honestly say that despite all the struggles, I am more thrilled than ever to continue pursuing this exciting and ever evolving field!
                    </p>  
                    <p> More to come... </p>
